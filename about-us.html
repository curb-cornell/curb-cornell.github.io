<p>The Cornell Undergraduate Research Board (CURB) seeks to enhance the Cornell undergraduate experience by promoting and enriching undergraduate research on campus. CURB is committed to fostering academic excellence through undergraduate interaction at events that bring student endeavors to the forefront of the Cornell community's attention.</p>
<p><img src="./images/logo.png" style="width:20%;float:left"/></p>
<p>There's no typical undergraduate experience, and furthermore, there is no typical undergraduate research experience. CURB's mission is to help undergraduates with a nascent desire for research to find their niche at Cornell; a process that we hope aids them in defining themselves and their dreams for the future. If you are currently doing undergraduate research, we'd like to learn more about your project: take our survey.</p>
<p>The seal of the Cornell Undergraduate Research Board is pictured at left. The circle alludes to the all-encompassing nature of CURB. We actively seek to include students from all seven colleges at Cornell. The four letters of our acronym represent a keyhole, alluding to Franklin's experiment, and symbolize the spirit of curiosity and achievement that we seek to encourage.</p>
<p>If you're interested in getting emails about upcoming events related to undergraduate research, or if you'd like to join the Cornell Undergraduate Research Board click here.</p>
<p>CURB also keeps a calendar of upcoming events sponsored by CURB or of interest to undergraduate researchers.</p>
<h1>Sponsors</h1>
<p>We thank our sponsors for their continued support for Cornell undergraduate research.</p>
