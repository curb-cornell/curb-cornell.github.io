title: About Peer Mentorship

* Want to get involved in research?
* Interested in developing leadership experience and helping out students learn about research?

## Become a CURB Peer Advisor!

CURB is looking for students who would like to serve as research peer advisors [apply here].
Research peer advisors serve as mentors for students who are interested in finding research positions and have questions regarding undergraduate research experiences at Cornell. This is a good opportunity to build leadership and communication skills. Advisors will be matched with 3 to 5 students with similar research and academic interests.

Program Details/Mentor Responsibilities:

* Work in small mentor groups (organized by similar research fields/interests) to plan an event for mentees in order to illustrate undergraduate research experiences in their particular fields
* Participate in the CURB Peer Mentorship online forum discussion board and answer questions from mentees and other Cornell undergraduates interested in research host lab tours for mentees in the program (not required)
* Mentor groups will be assigned mentees; within each group, each mentor will be responsible for ~4-6 students
* Attend monthly mentor/Peer Mentorship Committee meetings to provide updates for all mentees
* Mentors can decide how to structure their interactions with their mentees - whether biweekly meetings, emails, etc.
* Mentors will be responsible for providing advice to their mentees on a need-basis
* There will be an end-of-the-semester celebration for mentors and mentees!!

Becoming a CURB Research Peer Advisor is not an incredible time commitment over the semester, but it makes a huge difference to the mentees.

## Advisees 

Want to do undergraduate research, but unsure about where to start? Students from all colleges at Cornell may apply to be mentored by a research peer advisor. [apply here].

Advisees will be matched with a research peer advisor with similar research and academic interests. Advisees can use their peer advisors as an important resource to ask for advice on finding research positions or on careers in research. As advisee, you will hear first-hand experiences from those who have already been in your position.

Advisees and peer advisors may organize personal meetings, but CURB presents social activities throughout the semester, including luncheons with peer advisors and bowling and skating nights that everyone can enjoy.
